# Security Documentation

## Overview

This application implements **military-grade encryption** to protect user data. The encryption is designed so that **ONLY the user with the correct passphrase can decrypt their data**. This document explains the security measures, potential attack vectors, and limitations.

## üîí Encryption Implementation

### Core Security Features

1. **AES-256-GCM Encryption**
   - Industry-standard symmetric encryption
   - 256-bit key length (unbreakable with current technology)
   - Galois/Counter Mode provides authenticated encryption
   - Each record has unique Initialization Vector (IV)
   - Authentication tags prevent tampering

2. **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**
   - 100,000 iterations with SHA256
   - Unique salt per encryption configuration
   - Prevents rainbow table attacks
   - Computationally expensive to brute force

3. **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**
   - Passphrases are NEVER stored in any form
   - Keys are derived in real-time from passphrases
   - Verification uses encrypted "correct" value
   - Server cannot decrypt data without user passphrase

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Guarantees

### What IS Secure

‚úÖ **Data at Rest**: All user data in database is encrypted with AES-256-GCM
‚úÖ **Passphrase Security**: Passphrases are never stored, only used for key derivation
‚úÖ **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data
‚úÖ **Tamper Protection**: Authentication tags prevent data modification
‚úÖ **Brute Force Protection**: Rate limiting prevents automated attacks
‚úÖ **Memory Security**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when possible

### What Users Should Know

‚ö†Ô∏è **Passphrase is EVERYTHING**: If you forget your passphrase, your data is permanently lost
‚ö†Ô∏è **No Recovery Possible**: Even administrators cannot recover forgotten passphrases
‚ö†Ô∏è **Unique Passphrases**: Use different passphrases for different encryptions
‚ö†Ô∏è **Strong Passphrases**: Weak passphrases can be cracked with enough computing power

## üö® Potential Attack Vectors & Mitigations

### 1. Database Compromise

**Attack**: Attacker gains direct database access
**Mitigation**: 
- All data is encrypted with unique keys
- Attacker still needs individual passphrases
- PBKDF2 makes brute forcing computationally expensive
- **Verdict**: Data remains secure ‚úÖ

### 2. Server/API Compromise

**Attack**: Attacker gains server access
**Mitigation**:
- Passphrases are not stored anywhere
- Keys exist only temporarily in memory
- Memory cleanup attempts to clear sensitive data
- **Limitation**: Active sessions could be compromised ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 3. Administrator Access

**Attack**: System administrator tries to access user data
**Mitigation**:
- Administrators can see encrypted data but cannot decrypt it
- No backdoors or master keys exist
- Database access shows only encrypted blobs
- **Verdict**: Admin cannot decrypt data without passphrases ‚úÖ

### 4. Network Interception (Man-in-the-Middle)

**Attack**: Network traffic interception
**Mitigation**:
- HTTPS encryption in transit
- Nginx reverse proxy with security headers
- **Requirement**: Proper SSL/TLS certificate needed ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 5. Client-Side Attacks

**Attack**: Browser compromise, XSS, malware
**Mitigation**:
- Content Security Policy headers
- Input sanitization
- **Limitation**: Client-side compromises can steal passphrases ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 6. Brute Force Attacks

**Attack**: Automated passphrase guessing
**Mitigation**:
- Rate limiting: 10 attempts per IP per encryption
- 15-minute blocks for failed attempts
- PBKDF2 makes each attempt computationally expensive
- **Verdict**: Effectively prevented ‚úÖ

### 7. Timing Attacks

**Attack**: Measuring response times to guess information
**Mitigation**:
- Constant-time responses for authentication failures
- Hash-based logging prevents sensitive data leaks
- **Verdict**: Protected ‚úÖ

### 8. Memory Dumps

**Attack**: Reading server memory for sensitive data
**Mitigation**:
- Attempt to clear sensitive data from memory
- Keys exist only temporarily
- **Limitation**: JavaScript cannot securely clear string memory ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 9. Quantum Computing (Future Threat)

**Attack**: Quantum computers breaking AES-256
**Mitigation**:
- AES-256 is quantum-resistant for the foreseeable future
- PBKDF2 with SHA256 provides additional protection
- **Timeline**: Not a concern for 20+ years ‚úÖ

## üîê What Administrators CAN and CANNOT Do

### Administrators CAN:
- See user account information (names, emails)
- See encrypted data blobs in the database
- See encryption configuration names
- Monitor API usage and logs
- Reset rate limiting records
- Backup/restore encrypted data

### Administrators CANNOT:
- Decrypt any user data without passphrases
- Recover forgotten passphrases
- Access user data in readable form
- Create backdoors to bypass encryption
- See original text content

### Database Administrator Example:
```sql
-- This is what a database admin sees:
SELECT * FROM encrypted_data LIMIT 1;

+----------+---------+---------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| data_id  | user_id | encryption_id | iv               | encrypted_text   | tag              |
+----------+---------+---------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+
| 1        | 123     | 456           | dGVzdGl2MTIzNDU= | xK8vQ2yF...      | zKj9PmL...       |
+----------+---------+---------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+

-- This is completely unreadable without the user's passphrase
```

## üéØ Security Best Practices for Users

### Strong Passphrases
```
‚ùå Bad: password123
‚ùå Bad: mybirthday1985
‚ùå Bad: qwerty
‚úÖ Good: MyDog$Fluffy!LovesWalking2024
‚úÖ Good: Coffee&Rain#MakeMe@Happy99
‚úÖ Good: Generated: Kp7#mX9vL2$nQ8wR
```

### Passphrase Management
- Use a different passphrase for each encryption
- Consider using a password manager
- Store backup copies in a secure location
- Never share passphrases with anyone
- Never send passphrases via email/chat

### Operational Security
- Always log out when finished
- Use private/incognito browsing on shared computers
- Verify HTTPS connection (green lock icon)
- Keep your device secure with screen locks
- Don't access from public/untrusted networks
