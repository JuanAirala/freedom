/* DESCRIPTION */
Freedom is a secure encrypted data storage application that provides 
military-grade AES-256 encryption for protecting sensitive information.
Users can store and manage their private data with complete privacy
using 64-character encryption keys and zero-knowledge architecture.

The application prioritizes security, privacy, and user control over
their data. All encryption happens client-side, ensuring that even
the service providers cannot access user data.
